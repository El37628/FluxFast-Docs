---
> **Version notice:** Examples follow stable **FluxFast 1.2.0**. Use matching Python and frontend packages; older 1.1 packages do not provide the React/Vite host or the new Core server/Codegen entry points. [Installation and upgrade steps](/FluxFast-Docs/version-guide/).

## v0.9.x to v1.0.0

FluxFast 1.0 promotes the public contract frozen in v0.9.0. Applications using
documented v0.9 APIs, generated files, and the `fluxfast/1` protocol should not
need an application rewrite. Upgrade the synchronized Python, Core, and Next
packages, regenerate typed artifacts, review the semantic diff, typecheck,
create a production build, run the production doctor, and deploy.

Do not rerun `fluxfast init` for an application already initialized with v0.9.
The initializer is for creating or repairing the adapter scaffold, not a routine
version upgrade. Follow the dedicated [v0.9 → v1.0 upgrade
guide](/FluxFast-Docs/upgrade-v1/) for commands, checks, and rollback guidance.

The release gate tests each package side against published v0.9.0 before testing
the matched candidate. It then reinstalls v0.9.0 in the same consumer,
regenerates, typechecks, builds, starts the production application, and verifies
that the initialized scaffold did not change. This rollback is an operational
fallback during adoption; matching package versions remain the recommended
deployment.

## v0.7.x to v0.8.0

FluxFast 0.8 expands server-owned contracts into general application models
and introduces native, dependency-free client validation.

This guide helps existing FluxFast 0.7 applications upgrade to 0.8.0. The release
maintains backward compatibility for the `fluxfast/1` browser wire protocol,
existing resource models, page URL routes, and generated type imports.

---

## v0.8.0 to v0.8.1 validation paths

FluxFast 0.8.1 corrects the formatted representation of numeric array indices.
The structured validation path does not change:

```ts
["rooms", 0, "rate"]
```

Its formatted form changes from the v0.8.0 output:

```text
rooms.0.rate
```

to the canonical v0.8.1 output:

```text
rooms[0].rate
```

Applications using only top-level errors are unaffected. Applications that
index nested entries directly must update
`form.errorMap["rooms.0.rate"]` to
`form.errorMap["rooms[0].rate"]`. FastAPI/Pydantic server failures now preserve
their complete nested location and converge on the same `errorMap` key.

---

## What's new in v0.8.0

1. **General Application Contracts (`flux.define_type`):** Define authoritative
   contracts with Pydantic that are not tied to page loaders or resource keys.
2. **`fluxfast-schema/2` Developer Manifest:** An expanded developer schema
   manifest format with deterministic fingerprinting covering general types and
   reusable mutation bodies.
3. **Unified Type Graph Compiler:** Shared definitions (`$defs`), deduplication,
   and collision detection across resources, mutations, and general types.
4. **Reusable Mutation Body Contracts:** Mutation request bodies generate
   exported interfaces (`${PascalCase}Body`) in `types.generated.ts`.
5. **Native Runtime Validation (`validators.generated.ts`):** Framework-neutral,
   zero-dependency validators powered by `@fluxfast/core`, replacing external
   libraries like Zod or Valibot for generated contracts.
6. **Form Validation with `useForm`:** Pre-submit client validation prevents
   invalid network requests and surfaces structured `issues` and canonical
   `errorMap` mappings alongside server validation errors.
7. **Tree-shakeable Bundles:** Applications that do not import validators pay
   zero runtime bundle overhead.

## Upgrade Steps

### 1. Update package dependencies

Update your Python and JavaScript dependencies to 0.8.0.

In `pyproject.toml` (or `requirements.txt`):

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "fluxfast>=0.8.0,<0.9.0",
]
```

In `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@fluxfast/core": "^0.8.0",
    "@fluxfast/next": "^0.8.0"
  }
}
```

Run your package manager install commands:

```bash
# Python
pip install -U fluxfast

# JavaScript
pnpm install # or npm install / yarn install / bun install
```

### 2. Regenerate contracts and validators

Python 0.8 emits `fluxfast-schema/2` manifests. Regenerate frontend contracts
using the full-stack helper:

```bash
fluxfast types backend.main:app --frontend frontend
```

Or from the frontend directory:

```bash
npx fluxfast generate
```

The generator will output:
- `src/.fluxfast/schema.generated.json` (schema/2 format)
- `src/.fluxfast/types.generated.ts` (models, general types, mutation bodies)
- `src/.fluxfast/validators.generated.ts` (native runtime validators)
- `src/.fluxfast/routes.generated.ts` (typed URL builders)
- `src/.fluxfast/mutations.generated.ts` (mutation helpers)
- `src/.fluxfast/pages.generated.ts` (page component registry)

> **Tooling Compatibility Note:** `@fluxfast/next` 0.8 can read both
> `fluxfast-schema/1` and `fluxfast-schema/2` manifests. However, legacy 0.7
> JavaScript tooling cannot read `fluxfast-schema/2` manifests and will exit with
> a diagnostic advising an upgrade of `@fluxfast/next`.

### 3. Replace dummy resources with general application contracts

If your 0.7 application declared dummy resources solely to export TypeScript
types for components or utilities, replace them with `flux.define_type()`:

```python
# Before (0.7 workaround using unused resource):
# USER_MODEL = flux.define_resource("unused_user", User)

# After (0.8 clean general contract):
USER = flux.define_type("User", User, mode="serialization")
CREATE_USER = flux.define_type(
    "CreateUserInput",
    CreateUserInput,
    mode="validation",
)
```

- Use `mode="serialization"` (default) for contracts describing server output.
- Use `mode="validation"` for contracts describing client input (forms, mutations).

### 4. Reuse mutation request body interfaces

In 0.7, mutation request bodies were defined as inline type literals inside
`mutations.generated.ts`. In 0.8, mutation bodies generate reusable named
interfaces in `types.generated.ts`:

```python
class CreateRoomInput(BaseModel):
    number: str
    floor: int


@flux.mutation("/hotels/{hotel_id}/rooms", name="create_room")
async def create_room(hotel_id: int, body: CreateRoomInput):
    ...
```

Frontend usage before:

```ts
// 0.7: Inline body type, hard to reuse in standalone components or forms
await mutations.createRoom(router, {
  params: { hotel_id: 42 },
  body: { number: "101", floor: 1 },
});
```

Frontend usage now:

```tsx
// 0.8: Import and reuse the named body contract
import type { CreateRoomBody } from "@/.fluxfast/types.generated";
import { CreateRoomBodyValidator } from "@/.fluxfast/validators.generated";
import { useForm } from "@fluxfast/next";

export function RoomForm() {
  const form = useForm<CreateRoomBody>(
    { number: "", floor: 1 },
    { validator: CreateRoomBodyValidator }
  );
  // ...
}
```

### 5. Replace third-party client validation schemas

If you maintained duplicate Zod, Valibot, or Yup schemas to validate forms on the
client, you can replace them with FluxFast's native generated validators:

```tsx
// Before (manual Zod duplicate):
// import { z } from "zod";
// const schema = z.object({ name: z.string().min(2), email: z.string().email() });

// After (native FluxFast validator):
import { CreateUserInputValidator } from "@/.fluxfast/validators.generated";

const result = CreateUserInputValidator.validate(formData);
if (!result.valid) {
  console.error(result.issues);
}
```

FluxFast validators have zero runtime dependencies and are tree-shaken if unused.

### 6. Upgrade `useForm` validation

Connect generated validators to `useForm` for instant client-side validation:

```tsx
import { useForm } from "@fluxfast/next";
import { CreateUserInputValidator } from "@/.fluxfast/validators.generated";

const form = useForm(
  { name: "", email: "" },
  { validator: CreateUserInputValidator }
);
```

- **Pre-submit validation:** `form.submit(url)` validates automatically before
  sending network requests. Invalid forms send **zero HTTP requests**.
- **Structured error state:**
  - `form.errors`: Top-level field errors (e.g., `form.errors.email`).
  - `form.issues`: Full structured `readonly ValidationIssue[]` array.
  - `form.errorMap`: Dot/bracket notation error mapping (e.g.,
    `form.errorMap["addresses[0].city"]`).
- **Authoritative server mapping:** Top-level server errors remain available in
  `form.errors`; nested errors use canonical keys such as
  `form.errorMap["addresses[0].city"]`.

### 7. Run `doctor` and check CI drift detection

Run `npx fluxfast doctor` inside your frontend to verify your configuration:

```bash
npx fluxfast doctor
```

`doctor` will check packages, Next.js catch-all routes, page components,
manifest versions, naming collisions, and validator plans.

In your CI pipeline, verify that generated code is current without modifying files:

```bash
fluxfast types backend.main:app --frontend frontend --check
```

---

## Backward Compatibility Guarantees

- **Browser Wire Protocol:** Stays `fluxfast/1`. No client transport changes are
  required.
- **Generated Types Imports:** Imports from `@/.fluxfast/types.generated`
  (`resourceKeys`, `FluxResourceMap`, typed resource interfaces) continue to work
  without modification.
- **Resource Loaders & Caching:** Resource loaders, scopes, live invalidations,
  and distributed Redis cache behavior are completely unaffected.
- **Runtime Mixed Versions:** Mixed versions (`0.8` Python with `0.7` JavaScript,
  and `0.7` Python with `0.8` JavaScript) continue to be tested and supported for
  safe phased deployments.

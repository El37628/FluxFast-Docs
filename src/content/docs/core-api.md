FluxFast 1.x treats the framework-neutral runtime exported from
the official `@fluxfast/core` package root as stable. The package intentionally
keeps its existing browser-facing public import path:

```ts
import { FluxRouter, createValidator } from "@fluxfast/core";
```

Deep imports into `dist` or source files are internal. The package's ESM and
CommonJS entry points expose the same named API.

Unreleased v1.2 foundation work adds a separate server integration path,
`@fluxfast/core/server`. It is not available in the published v1.1 packages.
Server helpers are never re-exported from the browser-facing root; existing
Next.js applications keep their current imports and behavior.

Application developers should begin with the [Stable APIs guide](/FluxFast-Docs/stable-apis/).
Adapter, transport, live-runtime, protocol, and validation-tooling authors
should also read [Advanced Stable APIs](/FluxFast-Docs/advanced-stable-apis/). This page is
the authoritative symbol inventory for both classifications.

## Common API inputs and outputs

Application components normally reach this runtime through `@fluxfast/next`.
The direct API is useful for adapter authors, non-React clients, validation,
and tests.

### Hydrate the framework-neutral runtime

`FluxRouter` accepts the same `PageEnvelope` returned by FastAPI. Supplying
`deferHistory: true` keeps this standalone example independent of the browser
History API.

```ts
import { FluxRouter, type PageEnvelope } from "@fluxfast/core";

const initialEnvelope: PageEnvelope = {
  protocol: "fluxfast/1",
  page: {
    component: "rooms/index",
    url: "/rooms",
    meta: { title: "Rooms" },
  },
  resources: {
    rooms: {
      version: "rooms-v1",
      value: [{ id: 101, status: "available" }],
    },
  },
};

const router = new FluxRouter({
  initialEnvelope,
  deferHistory: true,
});

console.log({
  page: router.pageStore.getSnapshot(),
  rooms: router.resourceStore.getSnapshot("rooms"),
  resourceStatus: router.resourceStore.getStateSnapshot("rooms").status,
});
```

Output:

```json
{
  "page": {
    "component": "rooms/index",
    "url": "/rooms",
    "meta": { "title": "Rooms" }
  },
  "rooms": [{ "id": 101, "status": "available" }],
  "resourceStatus": "ready"
}
```

Use `createFluxRuntime(options)` when a factory is more convenient; it returns
the same `FluxRouter` public runtime.

### Observe development diagnostics

Every `FluxRouter` owns a `diagnostics` hub. It is inactive until a development
tool subscribes, so normal application execution does not allocate diagnostic
events. The hub distributes observations only; it does not retain a runtime
timeline. Adapters may use `bootstrap()` for one bounded, one-shot batch
captured before a browser listener could exist, such as the initial SSR trace.
The first subscriber consumes that batch; long-term history remains the
DevTools consumer's responsibility.

```ts
const stop = router.diagnostics.subscribe(event => {
  console.log(event.type, event.correlationId, event.data);
});

await router.visit("/rooms?token=not-recorded");
stop();
```

A navigation emits correlated `navigation`, `page-cache`, and
`resource-update` observations. Runtime diagnostics contain bounded metadata
such as route paths, resource keys, versions, counts, phases, and error types.
They omit query strings, headers, request bodies, resource values, and raw
error messages. DevTools consumers should still treat the channel as
development-only and keep their own bounded history.

The built-in `FetchTransport` is attached automatically. While at least one
listener is active, it adds the development opt-in header, records bounded
browser timing, validates the response trace, and emits correlated `transport`
and `server-trace` observations. Removing the final listener restores the
ordinary request path and suppresses the opt-in header. Custom transports remain
compatible; they may implement the optional `attachDiagnostics(hub)` method to
participate.

For the current store state, use the value-free inspection snapshot:

```ts
console.log(router.resourceStore.getRecordsSnapshot());
```

```json
[
  {
    "key": "rooms",
    "version": "rooms-v1",
    "updatedAt": 1760000000000,
    "status": "ready",
    "stale": false,
    "hasSubscribers": true
  }
]
```

Pending or error-only resources use `null` for `version` and `updatedAt`. The
snapshot never contains `value`, error messages, or error detail objects.

### Validate unknown input

Generated validators use this API internally. A custom integration can also
construct a deterministic plan directly:

```ts
import { createValidator } from "@fluxfast/core";

interface Room {
  id: number;
  status: "available" | "occupied";
}

const roomValidator = createValidator<Room>({
  kind: "object",
  properties: {
    id: { kind: "integer", minimum: 1 },
    status: {
      kind: "enum",
      values: ["available", "occupied"],
    },
  },
  required: ["id", "status"],
  additionalProperties: false,
});

console.log(roomValidator.validate({ id: 0, status: "unknown" }));
```

Output:

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "issues": [
    {
      "path": ["id"],
      "code": "minimum",
      "message": "Value must be at least 1."
    },
    {
      "path": ["status"],
      "code": "enum",
      "message": "Value is not one of the allowed values."
    }
  ]
}
```

A valid input returns `{ valid: true, value, issues: [] }`. `is()` exposes a
TypeScript type guard, while `assert()` returns the typed value or throws
`ValidationError` with the same structured issues.

### Apply a mutation patch

`applyPatchToValue()` is the pure operation used by the resource store for one
patch. It does not mutate the input value.

```ts
import { applyPatchToValue } from "@fluxfast/core";

const rooms = [
  { id: 101, status: "available" },
  { id: 102, status: "occupied" },
];

const updated = applyPatchToValue(rooms, {
  op: "replace-item",
  id: 101,
  value: { id: 101, status: "occupied" },
});

console.log(updated);
```

Output:

```json
[
  { "id": 101, "status": "occupied" },
  { "id": 102, "status": "occupied" }
]
```

The runtime also supports `replace-resource`, `merge-object`, `remove-item`,
and `append-item` operations. The server remains responsible for deciding which
patches are authorized and authoritative.

## Classification

A stable API is part of the ordinary application or adapter-author surface. An
advanced stable API supports lower-level transport, cache, live, protocol, or
generated-validation integrations. Both classifications are supported
compatibility-sensitive API; advanced does not mean experimental.

The frozen v0.9.0 inventory remains machine-checked while reviewed, additive
1.x APIs are recorded explicitly. Every exported name must appear exactly once.

No `@fluxfast/core` root export is deprecated in v0.9. Runtime classes,
interfaces, constants, and helpers listed above remain supported even when
ordinary Next.js applications normally access them through `@fluxfast/next`.

## Server adapter primitives (unreleased v1.2)

These Advanced Stable APIs are for server-side adapter integrations, not React
components. They use standard `Headers`, `Request`, `Response`, and `fetch`
types without a framework or Node dependency. Diagnostics policy and the backend
address are explicit host inputs, never environment lookups inside Core.

<!-- core-server-api-advanced:start -->
```text
FetchFluxInitialPageOptions
FluxDevelopmentMetadata
FluxInitialPageResult
FluxTransportProxyOptions
removeFluxHopByHopHeaders
selectFluxForwardHeaders
```
<!-- core-server-api-advanced:end -->

### Select headers for initial SSR

```ts
import { selectFluxForwardHeaders } from "@fluxfast/core/server";

const incoming = new Headers({
  cookie: "session=example",
  authorization: "Bearer example",
  "accept-language": "en",
  "user-agent": "Example Browser",
  "x-tenant": "trusted-tenant-header",
  "x-unrelated": "do-not-forward",
  connection: "keep-alive, x-hop",
  "x-hop": "do-not-forward",
});

const forwarded = selectFluxForwardHeaders(incoming, ["X-Tenant", "X-Hop"]);
console.log(Object.fromEntries(forwarded));
```

Output (illustrative credentials only):

```json
{
  "accept-language": "en",
  "authorization": "Bearer example",
  "cookie": "session=example",
  "user-agent": "Example Browser",
  "x-tenant": "trusted-tenant-header"
}
```

The default allowlist contains cookie, authorization, accept-language, and
user-agent. The second argument adds explicit field names; it does not replace
the defaults. Names are case-insensitive and malformed configured names are
ignored. Standard hop-by-hop headers and fields nominated by `Connection` are
removed even when allowlisted. The input is never mutated.

Forwarding a header does not make its contents trustworthy. FastAPI must still
authenticate and authorize the request, including any tenant selection. Never
log a real `forwarded` collection or disclose credentials in an error report.

### Sanitize proxy request or response headers

```ts
import { removeFluxHopByHopHeaders } from "@fluxfast/core/server";

const clean = removeFluxHopByHopHeaders({
  "content-type": "text/event-stream",
  "cache-control": "no-cache, no-transform",
  "x-accel-buffering": "no",
  connection: "keep-alive, x-private-hop",
  "x-private-hop": "discard",
  "transfer-encoding": "chunked",
});
console.log(Object.fromEntries(clean));
```

```json
{
  "cache-control": "no-cache, no-transform",
  "content-type": "text/event-stream",
  "x-accel-buffering": "no"
}
```

This helper copies all end-to-end fields rather than applying the SSR allowlist.
It preserves separate `Set-Cookie` values and safe SSE/FluxFast headers. It strips
connection, content-length, host, keep-alive, proxy-authenticate,
proxy-authorization, te, trailer, transfer-encoding, upgrade, and valid
`Connection`-nominated fields. A proxy remains responsible for forwarding the
body as a stream and negotiating compression correctly; sanitizing headers alone
does not implement a transport proxy.

Invalid input headers produce a generic `TypeError("Invalid FluxFast headers")`
without reflecting the supplied value or attaching the native error as a cause.

### Server contract types

`FetchFluxInitialPageOptions` names an explicit backend URL, origin-relative
path, optional `HeadersInit`, optional injected `fetch`, optional diagnostics
flag, and optional redirect bound. `FluxInitialPageResult` is either a page
envelope with optional safe `FluxDevelopmentMetadata` or a `not-found` result
for the host to translate into its own response. `FluxTransportProxyOptions`
names the backend URL and an optional injected fetch implementation.

These types prepare the shared server contract. Initial-page fetching and the
generic proxy are added in subsequent foundation steps; this step exports only
the two header helpers. Next.js still owns its existing SSR and transport code.

Each exported type can also be used independently when describing an adapter
boundary. The declarations below are examples, not an instruction to replace
the current Next integration:

<!-- core-server-api-examples:start -->
| API | Declaration or use | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FetchFluxInitialPageOptions` | `const options: FetchFluxInitialPageOptions = { backendUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8000", path: "/rooms", diagnostics: false };` | Describe an initial-page read without coupling the contract to a framework or environment. |
| `FluxDevelopmentMetadata` | `const metadata: FluxDevelopmentMetadata = { initialPath: "/rooms", initialServerTrace: {} };` | Carry bounded, value-free development metadata separately from a page envelope. |
| `FluxInitialPageResult` | `const result: FluxInitialPageResult = { type: "not-found" };` | Let the host distinguish a missing page from a validated page result. |
| `FluxTransportProxyOptions` | `const options: FluxTransportProxyOptions = { backendUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8000", fetch: globalThis.fetch };` | Supply explicit transport configuration rather than letting Core read adapter environment variables. |
| `removeFluxHopByHopHeaders` | `const responseHeaders = removeFluxHopByHopHeaders(upstream.headers);` | Clone request or response headers and drop all per-hop fields. |
| `selectFluxForwardHeaders` | `const forwarded = selectFluxForwardHeaders(request.headers, ["X-Tenant"]);` | Limit SSR forwarding to the four defaults and intentional additions after sanitation. |
<!-- core-server-api-examples:end -->

## Export-barrel decision

The source entry point retains its existing `export *` barrels. Replacing 156
known exports with one long hand-maintained statement would not improve runtime
behavior and could accidentally change type/value namespace exports. Instead,
CI compares the built declaration surface to the v0.8.1 snapshot and compares
that snapshot to the complete classification above. Adding, removing, or
renaming a barrel export therefore requires an intentional API review.

## Runtime neutrality

`@fluxfast/core` has no runtime dependencies and must remain independent of UI
frameworks. Its source and package metadata are checked to prevent imports or
dependencies on React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, and Solid. Browser platform types
and APIs such as `fetch`, `AbortController`, `history`, and `ReadableStream`
remain allowed; adapters supply framework-specific rendering.

## Contract boundaries

This classification does not itself change the `fluxfast/1` protocol,
capability tokens, validation semantics, or mutation behavior. Dedicated v0.9
reviews document those contracts independently. See [architecture](/FluxFast-Docs/architecture/),
[versioning](/FluxFast-Docs/versioning/), [protocol](/FluxFast-Docs/protocol/), and [native client
validation](/FluxFast-Docs/validation/).

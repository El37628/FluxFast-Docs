> **Version notice:** Examples follow stable **FluxFast 1.2.0**. Use matching Python and frontend packages; older 1.1 packages do not provide the React/Vite host or the new Core server/Codegen entry points. [Installation and upgrade steps](/FluxFast-Docs/version-guide/).

FluxFast 0.8 provides a first-party, dependency-free runtime validation system.
Supported validation plans are compiled directly from authoritative Python and
Pydantic contracts into `@/.fluxfast/validators.generated.ts`.

Developers do not need to install or maintain Zod, Valibot, Yup, Joi, or AJV
for ordinary application validation.

## Core principles

### 1. Client validation is UX, not security authority

Client validation gives immediate feedback in the browser and prevents invalid
network requests. It is not an authorization or security boundary. FastAPI and
Pydantic remain the authoritative backend validators for all business logic,
security checks, and persisted state.

### 2. Zero third-party validation dependencies

FluxFast validators run entirely on a lightweight evaluator built into
`@fluxfast/core`. Consuming applications require no external schema packages.

### 3. No double-validation of server responses

Typed resources emitted by FastAPI are already validated and serialized on the
server. FluxFast does not automatically re-validate received resources in the
browser, avoiding redundant client-side CPU overhead. Native validators are
designed for:
- Form inputs
- Mutation payloads
- Client-side application data
- Local storage and persisted state
- External API boundaries

---

## The validator API

Generated validators implement the `FluxValidator<T>` interface from `@fluxfast/core`:

```ts
export interface FluxValidator<T> {
  /** Validate a value and return structured issues without throwing. */
  validate(value: unknown): ValidationResult<T>;

  /** Type guard that returns true if the value matches the contract. */
  is(value: unknown): value is T;

  /** Return the validated value, or throw a ValidationError with all issues. */
  assert(value: unknown): T;
}
```

### Validation results and issues

The result of calling `validator.validate(data)` is a discriminated union:

```ts
export type ValidationResult<T> =
  | {
      valid: true;
      value: T;
      issues: readonly [];
    }
  | {
      valid: false;
      issues: readonly ValidationIssue[];
    };
```

Each `ValidationIssue` contains:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | `readonly (string \| number)[]` | Array of keys or array indices indicating where the error occurred |
| `code` | `string` | Machine-readable evaluator code (e.g., `type`, `minLength`) or application refinement code |
| `message` | `string` | Human-readable error description |

Use `formatValidationPath(issue.path)` from `@fluxfast/core` to format path arrays
into standard JavaScript dot/bracket notation (e.g., `users[0].contact.email`).
Numeric array indices always use brackets; the underlying path remains structured
as `readonly (string | number)[]`.

---

## Quick example

### 1. Define the contract in Python

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, Field
from fluxfast import FluxFast


class RegistrationInput(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(min_length=2, max_length=50)
    email: EmailStr
    age: int = Field(ge=18)


flux.define_type(
    "RegistrationInput",
    RegistrationInput,
    mode="validation",
)
```

### 2. Generate contracts and validators

```bash
fluxfast types backend.main:app --frontend frontend
```

### 3. Use in your frontend

```ts
import { formatValidationPath } from "@fluxfast/core";
import type { RegistrationInput } from "@/.fluxfast/types.generated";
import { RegistrationInputValidator } from "@/.fluxfast/validators.generated";

const input: unknown = {
  name: "Alice",
  email: "invalid-email",
  age: 16,
};

const result = RegistrationInputValidator.validate(input);

if (!result.valid) {
  for (const issue of result.issues) {
    console.error(formatValidationPath(issue.path), issue.message);
  }
} else {
  // result.value is strongly typed as RegistrationInput
  console.log("Valid input:", result.value.name);
}
```

## Generated validators (`validators.generated.ts`)

When `fluxfast types` or `fluxfast generate` runs, it outputs
`@/.fluxfast/validators.generated.ts` containing:

- **Type contract validators:** Supported types declared with `flux.define_type()`
  produce matching `${Name}Validator` instances.
- **Resource validators:** Supported typed resource schemas produce matching
  resource validators.
- **Mutation body validators:** Supported JSON mutation body schemas produce
  `${PascalCaseName}BodyValidator` instances.

Contracts with unsupported validation semantics are listed in
`validatorDiagnostics` and do not receive a weakened validator.

### Pure construction and tree-shaking

Validator factories are marked as pure:

```ts
export const RegistrationInputValidator = /* @__PURE__ */ createValidator<RegistrationInput>({
  kind: "object",
  properties: { ... },
});
```

If your application only imports `RegistrationInputValidator`, unused validators
and their static validation plans are eliminated during production bundling.
Applications that do not import any validators incur zero runtime validation
overhead.

---

## Supported validation constraints

FluxFast compiles JSON Schema constraints emitted by Pydantic:

### Strings
- `minLength`, `maxLength`
- `pattern` (regular expressions evaluated safely)
- Formats:
  - `email`
  - `uuid`
  - `date-time`, `date`, `time`
  - `uri`
  - `ipv4`, `ipv6`

### Numbers & integers
- `minimum`, `maximum`
- `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`
- `multipleOf`
- `integer` checks

### Objects
- `properties` and `required` fields
- `additionalProperties` (enforces strict schema boundaries when configured)
- Nested object evaluation

### Arrays
- `items` element validation
- `minItems`, `maxItems`

### Unions, literals, and enums
- `anyOf` / `oneOf` unions
- Literal constants
- Enumerations
- Nullable and optional fields

### Recursive and self-referencing types
Hierarchical models (such as comment trees, category hierarchies, or organization
charts) use local schema definitions (`$defs`) and are evaluated safely without
infinite recursion.

### Unsupported keywords
If a Pydantic contract produces schema keywords that the client evaluator cannot
safely verify, the code generator emits an explicit diagnostic. Unsupported
semantics are never silently dropped.

TypeScript contract generation and native validator generation are independent.
For example, a schema containing `uniqueItems` can still produce an accurate
TypeScript array type, but its native validator is omitted because the runtime
does not implement uniqueness semantics. Other supported contracts continue to
receive validators.

> FluxFast never silently drops a validation-affecting JSON Schema keyword. If
> native validation cannot faithfully represent a contract, the validator is
> omitted and generation reports a diagnostic.

---

## Runtime safety and denial-of-service prevention

The validator evaluator includes defensive runtime protections. The exported
`DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_*` constants are the source of truth for these defaults:

1. **Recursion depth limits:** Evaluator traversal is bounded (`maxDepth: 64` by
   default) to protect against deep or self-referencing inputs.
2. **Operation bounds:** Total evaluation steps are tracked (`maxOperations: 100,000`
   by default) to prevent CPU starvation from hostile combinatorial inputs.
3. **Issue limits:** Traversal caps the number of collected issues (`maxIssues: 100`
   by default) to avoid unbounded memory allocation.
4. **Property limits:** Each object or collection is bounded by
   `maxProperties: 10,000` by default.
5. **Prototype-safe properties:** Names such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, and
   `prototype` are treated as data keys, not instructions to change prototypes.
6. **Cycle detection:** Hostile cyclic JavaScript objects are detected without
   causing browser stack overflow errors.

```ts
import {
  DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_DEPTH,
  DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_ISSUES,
  DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_OPERATIONS,
  DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_PROPERTIES,
} from "@fluxfast/core";

export const validationDefaults = {
  maxDepth: DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_DEPTH,
  maxIssues: DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_ISSUES,
  maxOperations: DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_OPERATIONS,
  maxProperties: DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MAX_PROPERTIES,
} as const;
```

---

## Synchronous validator refinements

To implement business rules that cross multiple fields (such as checking that a
confirmation password matches), use `refineValidator()`:

```ts
import { refineValidator } from "@fluxfast/core";
import { RegisterInputValidator } from "@/.fluxfast/validators.generated";

export const ValidatedRegister = refineValidator(
  RegisterInputValidator,
  (value) => {
    if (value.password !== value.confirmPassword) {
      return {
        path: ["confirmPassword"],
        code: "custom",
        message: "Passwords must match",
      };
    }
    return null; // Valid!
  }
);
```

### Refinement rules
- Refinements run **only after** schema validation succeeds, so `value` is guaranteed
  to be typed and structurally valid.
- Refinements must be **synchronous**.
- Refinements return a `ValidationIssue`, or `null` / `undefined` when valid.
- Refinements **cannot transform or mutate** values.

FluxFast intentionally does not include an asynchronous refinement system or a
heavy schema-builder DSL. Async checks (such as verifying email uniqueness in a
database) belong on the FastAPI backend where authorization and transactions can be
safely applied.

## Client feedback and server authority

Generated client validation is an early feedback layer. It never replaces the
authoritative mutation boundary:

```text
Pydantic model (supported contract)
     ↓
generated client schema and validator
     ↓
fast browser validation
     ↓
request
     ↓
FastAPI and Pydantic
     ↓
authoritative validation
     ↓
nested server error
     ↓
useForm.errorMap
```

Native client validation improves UX and reduces avoidable requests. FastAPI and
Pydantic remain authoritative for every submitted mutation. A Python-only rule
can therefore accept the generated client structure but reject, for example,
`address.postcode`; `useForm` exposes that response at
`form.errorMap["address.postcode"]`.

---

## Form integration with `useForm`

`@fluxfast/next` provides native integration between `useForm` and FluxFast
validators:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useForm } from "@fluxfast/next";
import type { CreateUserInput } from "@/.fluxfast/types.generated";
import { CreateUserInputValidator } from "@/.fluxfast/validators.generated";

export function RegistrationForm() {
  const form = useForm<CreateUserInput>(
    {
      name: "",
      email: "",
      age: 18,
    },
    {
      validator: CreateUserInputValidator,
    }
  );

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.submit("/api/users")}>
      <div>
        <label>Name</label>
        <input
          value={form.data.name}
          onChange={(e) => form.setData("name", e.target.value)}
        />
        {form.errors.name && <span className="error">{form.errors.name}</span>}
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>Email</label>
        <input
          value={form.data.email}
          onChange={(e) => form.setData("email", e.target.value)}
        />
        {form.errors.email && <span className="error">{form.errors.email}</span>}
      </div>

      <button type="submit" disabled={form.processing}>
        {form.processing ? "Registering..." : "Register"}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### How `useForm` validation behaves

1. **Pre-submit validation:** When the user submits the form, `useForm` runs the
   validator synchronously before sending an HTTP request. If the data is invalid,
   **zero network requests are sent**, and `form.errors`, `form.issues`, and
   `form.errorMap` are populated immediately.
2. **Manual validation:** You can trigger validation anytime by calling
   `const isValid = form.validate()`.
3. **Structured error state:**
   - `form.errors`: Top-level field errors for convenient single-level form bindings
     (e.g., `form.errors.email`).
   - `form.issues`: The complete, structured `readonly ValidationIssue[]` array.
   - `form.errorMap`: A frozen dictionary mapping formatted string paths to error
     messages (e.g., `form.errorMap["addresses[0].zip"]`).
4. **Server validation coexistence:** If client-side validation passes, the request
   proceeds to FastAPI. Any FluxFast validation envelope returned by the server
   replaces stale client feedback. Top-level server failures remain available in
   `form.errors`; use canonical `form.errorMap` keys such as `address.postcode` or
   `addresses[0].postcode` for nested failures.
5. **Selective error clearing:** Calling `form.clearErrors("email")` clears errors
   for that field while preserving other validation feedback.

## Stable 1.x validation contract

The validation behavior frozen against v0.9.0 is stable throughout 1.x. The
contract covers `FluxValidator<T>`, `ValidationResult`, `ValidationIssue`,
Core's `ValidationError`, `refineValidator`, canonical paths, and `useForm`.

`validate` returns a discriminated success/failure result; successful `value`
and `assert` preserve the input's identity. Validation does not coerce strings
to numbers, insert defaults, transform values, or freeze the caller's object.
Failed results have issues and no `value`. `assert` throws Core's
`ValidationError` with the issue array in `details`. Server transport errors use
the same class with a canonical field-to-messages dictionary instead; these two
details shapes must not be confused. Refinements run only after successful base
validation and propagate programmer exceptions. They must not mutate input;
FluxFast does not sandbox application callbacks.

Structured paths retain numeric indices: `["rooms", 0, "rate"]` formats as
`rooms[0].rate`. Unsafe property names use quoted bracket notation. Local root
issues format as `$`; authoritative server model/root failures use `general`.
FastAPI locations lose their request-source prefix (`body`, `query`, `path`,
`header`, or `cookie`), while actual nested keys, array indices, and validation
aliases are retained. Declared union branch labels and root-model wrappers are
not form fields. Multiple server messages at one canonical path remain grouped;
`useForm` displays the first message.

The form state contract is:

| Surface | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `data`, `setData` | Key and partial-object updates shallow-merge; updater functions return the next object and see preceding updates, including within one event. |
| `reset` | Restores all or selected keys from initial values; does not clear errors or success state. Treat initial and nested values as immutable. |
| `issues` | Structured client issues; server errors do not synthesize client issues. |
| `errors`, `errorMap` | Client errors use the first message per top-level key / canonical path respectively. Server errors retain canonical keys in both. `errorMap` is frozen. |
| `setError`, `clearErrors` | Manual errors are additive; client issues win collisions. Clearing a selected top-level key removes its client issues and the exact manual key, not every nested server key. No arguments clears all errors. |
| `validate` | Checks current data and replaces client issues, without submitting or clearing manual/server errors; no validator means success. |
| `submit`, `processing` | Clears previous feedback, blocks invalid client data, otherwise sends a mutation (POST by default). Processing covers the pending mutation and clears on settlement. Non-validation failures propagate. |
| `wasSuccessful` | Reset when a submission starts; set on successful mutation. |
| `recentlySuccessful` | True for two seconds after success; another success restarts the timer. A later failure does not erase the preceding recent-success window. |

Client acceptance never overrides server rejection. Unsupported validation
semantics continue to omit the affected validator with explicit diagnostics,
while TypeScript contracts and supported validators can still be generated.
This freeze does not add complete JSON Schema support or promise exact
human-readable diagnostic wording.

Contract coverage lives in Core's `validation.test.ts`, Next's `form.test.tsx`
and `validator-compiler.test.ts`, and Python's `test_validation_errors.py`.

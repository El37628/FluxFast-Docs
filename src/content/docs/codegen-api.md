> **Version notice:** Examples follow stable **FluxFast 1.2.0**. Use matching Python and frontend packages; older 1.1 packages do not provide the React/Vite host or the new Core server/Codegen entry points. [Installation and upgrade steps](/FluxFast-Docs/version-guide/).

`@fluxfast/codegen` is the Node.js, framework-neutral compiler package introduced
in **FluxFast 1.2**. It is not part of the older v1.1.0 payload. See the
[versioned release notes](/FluxFast-Docs/releases/v1-2-0/) for installation and availability;
a source version change alone is not evidence of registry publication.

Ordinary Next.js projects should continue using `fluxfast generate`,
`fluxfast types APP`, and the existing `@fluxfast/next/generate` API. Their
arguments and output remain unchanged. This lower-level package is for adapter
authors and tooling that must compile a FastAPI-owned manifest without installing
React or Next.js. It does not define backend routes or replace runtime validation.

The root export is the only public JavaScript entry point. All exports below are classified
as **Advanced Stable upon v1.2 publication**. Internal compiler modules, naming
helpers, filesystem helpers, and private deep imports are not public APIs.
The separate `fluxfast-codegen` binary is documented below; its private CLI
implementation is not an importable package API.

## Generic Codegen CLI

The new binary is named `fluxfast-codegen`, not `fluxfast`. It can be installed
alongside Next's existing `fluxfast` binary without a package-manager name
collision. Existing Next.js applications may keep `fluxfast generate`; both
commands delegate to the same scanner, schema compilers, and safe writer.
The existing Next CLI also retains its application-package compatibility checks;
the generic CLI only compiles artifacts and does not validate an installed runtime.

The command and meaningful flags are:

```sh
fluxfast-codegen generate --adapter next --schema-file backend-schema.json
fluxfast-codegen generate --adapter next --schema-file backend-schema.json --check
fluxfast-codegen generate --adapter react --schema-file backend-schema.json
fluxfast-codegen generate --adapter react --schema-file backend-schema.json --check
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--adapter next` | Selects the existing Next registry target. `next` remains the default. |
| `--adapter react` | Selects the shared React registry target, without a Next client directive. Other target names fail rather than silently selecting Next. |
| `--schema-file PATH` | Reads an authoritative exported manifest relative to the directory where the command was invoked, validates it, and includes its exact bytes in generation or drift checking. |
| `--check` | Compares expected artifacts without creating directories or changing files. |

The CLI finds the nearest `package.json` in the current directory or its parents
without evaluating project configuration. The Next target uses the same root or
`src/` layout precedence as the legacy Next CLI. It scans that layout's
`flux-pages` directory and writes to its `.fluxfast` directory.
Without `--schema-file`, it reads an existing `.fluxfast/schema.generated.json`;
if neither schema source exists, it generates or checks only the registry.

The React target uses `src/flux-pages` and `src/.fluxfast` when the project has
a `src/` directory, otherwise `flux-pages` and `.fluxfast` at the project root.
Next's `app`/`pages` routing-directory precedence does not apply to React. For
example, `src/flux-pages/home/index.tsx` exports your `Home` component; generation
adds a lazy `"home/index"` allowlist entry and a `FluxApplication` wrapper using
`FluxRoot` from `@fluxfast/react`. FastAPI still selects that identifier and owns
the URL. The registry is not a filesystem-based browser router.

The five schema-derived files have the same bytes for Next and React. Only
`pages.generated.ts` changes its runtime import and client-directive policy.
Compiling a React registry requires the React bindings in the consumer; running
the compiler does not. React SSR rendering and hydration are documented in
[React SSR boundaries](/FluxFast-Docs/react-ssr/). Host initialization and serving belong to
the separate [Vite integration](/FluxFast-Docs/vite-host/), not this compiler target.
Python 1.2 also provides React generation and host supervision. Both hosts run
the same [browser conformance contracts](https://github.com/El37628/FluxFast/blob/main/tests/adapter-conformance/README.md).

For a `src/` project with an exported schema whose validators are all supported,
successful generation prints:

```text
✓ Generated FluxFast schema at src/.fluxfast/schema.generated.json
✓ Generated FluxFast registry at src/.fluxfast/pages.generated.ts
✓ Generated FluxFast types from src/.fluxfast/schema.generated.json
  src/.fluxfast/types.generated.ts
  src/.fluxfast/validators.generated.ts
  src/.fluxfast/routes.generated.ts
  src/.fluxfast/mutations.generated.ts
```

The corresponding successful check prints:

```text
✓ Generated FluxFast files are current.
```

Exit `0` means generation succeeded or checked files are current. Exit `1`
means missing/stale files or a project, input, compilation, or filesystem error.
Exit `2` means invalid command usage, repeated/missing flags, or an unsupported
adapter. Unsupported-validator diagnostics remain visible even when generation
or checking succeeds; they do not weaken backend validation. Compilation errors
leave existing artifacts unchanged, and check mode is always read-only.

After version 1.2.0 is available on npm, install matching build-time packages in
the frontend and use the installed binary:

```sh
npm install @fluxfast/core@1.2.0
npm install --save-dev @fluxfast/codegen@1.2.0
npm exec --no -- fluxfast-codegen generate --adapter next --schema-file backend-schema.json
npm exec --no -- fluxfast-codegen generate --adapter next --schema-file backend-schema.json --check
```

For source development before publication, build Core and Codegen first, then
invoke the local binary **from the frontend project**:

```sh
# In the FluxFast source checkout:
corepack pnpm --filter @fluxfast/core build
corepack pnpm --filter @fluxfast/codegen build

# In the consuming frontend, using the actual path to that checkout:
node /path/to/FluxFast/packages/codegen/bin/fluxfast-codegen.js generate --adapter next --schema-file backend-schema.json
node /path/to/FluxFast/packages/codegen/bin/fluxfast-codegen.js generate --adapter next --schema-file backend-schema.json --check
```

The compiler does not need React or Next.js installed to run. Its generated
Next registry does need the selected runtime when the application compiles and
renders. The Python 1.2 `fluxfast types` command detects the
Next or React/Vite adapter and prefers this installed binary, with target-specific
installed fallbacks. Next still supports older JavaScript packages. See the [adapter-aware handoff](/FluxFast-Docs/type-safety/#adapter-aware-handoff-unreleased-v12)
for explicit selection and mixed-tooling behavior; published v1.1 Python keeps
its existing command.

## Compile without writing files

Export the manifest from the authoritative FastAPI application first:

```sh
fluxfast schema backend:app --output backend-schema.json
```

Then a Node.js tool can inspect or compile it. This example requires Codegen 1.2+
(or its source-built candidate), not the older published v1.1 packages:

```js
import fs from "node:fs";
import {
  parseFluxFastSchemaManifest,
  compileFluxFastResourceTypes,
  compileFluxFastValidatorsWithDiagnostics,
  compileFluxFastPageRoutes,
  compileFluxFastMutations,
} from "@fluxfast/codegen";

const manifest = parseFluxFastSchemaManifest(
  fs.readFileSync("backend-schema.json", "utf8"),
);
const types = compileFluxFastResourceTypes(manifest);
const validation = compileFluxFastValidatorsWithDiagnostics(manifest);
const routes = compileFluxFastPageRoutes(manifest);
const mutations = compileFluxFastMutations(manifest);

console.log(typeof types, typeof routes, typeof mutations);
// string string string — each is deterministic TypeScript source.
console.log(validation.contracts);
// e.g. ["RegistrationInput", "CreateRoomBody"] for supported input contracts.
console.log(validation.diagnostics);
// [] when every contract is supported; otherwise precise contract/path reasons.
```

Diagnostics never mean an unsupported contract received a weaker validator.
That contract's validator is omitted; its TypeScript type remains available,
and FastAPI still validates every actual request. Strict
`compileFluxFastValidators(manifest)` throws instead of reporting omissions.

## Build a native validation plan

```js
import { compileJsonSchemaToValidationPlan } from "@fluxfast/codegen";

console.log(compileJsonSchemaToValidationPlan({ type: "string", minLength: 2 }));
// { root: { kind: "string", minLength: 2 } }
```

This returns plan data, not a validation result. An application uses Core's
native validation runtime to evaluate a value against the plan. Generation
itself does not execute the Core runtime.

## Generate and check a project

Codegen's shared scanner renders a registry from the adapter's explicit runtime
target. The adapter selects its exports; Codegen owns scanning, rendering,
artifact compilation, and replacement safeguards. For a Next project, keep the
higher-level Next API; it supplies the unchanged Next target automatically.
This lower-level example scans existing frontend page modules:

```js
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";
import {
  createPagesRegistrySnapshot,
  generateFluxFastProject,
  checkFluxFastProject,
} from "@fluxfast/codegen";

const generatedDir = path.resolve("src/.fluxfast");
const registry = createPagesRegistrySnapshot({
  pagesDir: "src/flux-pages",
  outputFile: path.join(generatedDir, "pages.generated.ts"),
  target: {
    runtimeImport: "@fluxfast/next",
    rootExport: "FluxRoot",
    applicationPropsExport: "FluxApplicationProps",
    clientDirective: true,
  },
});
const options = {
  registry,
  generatedDir,
  schemaContent: fs.readFileSync("backend-schema.json", "utf8"),
  log: false,
};

const result = generateFluxFastProject(options);
console.log(result.generatedFiles.map(file => path.basename(file)));
// ["pages.generated.ts", "types.generated.ts", "validators.generated.ts",
//  "routes.generated.ts", "mutations.generated.ts"]
console.log(path.basename(result.registryPath));
// pages.generated.ts — also available directly as registryPath.
console.log(path.basename(result.schemaFile));
// schema.generated.json — persisted schema is reported separately.

const check = checkFluxFastProject(options);
console.log(check.current, check.staleFiles);
// true []
```

If `src/flux-pages/home/index.tsx` exists, `registry.identifiers` includes
`"home/index"`, and its registry entry lazy-loads that allowlisted module. The
snapshot contains source text and resolved paths but creates no files or
directories. An absent source directory returns an empty registry without
creating it. Test/spec/story files and private `_`-prefixed basenames are omitted;
nested symlinks are not followed. Unsafe page paths and duplicate identifiers
are rejected. No backend URL, credentials, or authorization decision belongs
in this registry.

## Select an explicit registry target

The shared scanner has no built-in `@fluxfast/next` target. The following is
an illustrative **React-style host contract**, not an additional released adapter:

```ts
import { createPagesRegistrySnapshot } from "@fluxfast/codegen";
import type { FluxPageRegistryTarget, PagesRegistryOptions } from "@fluxfast/codegen";

const target: FluxPageRegistryTarget = {
  runtimeImport: "@acme/host-runtime",
  rootExport: "ApplicationRoot",
  applicationPropsExport: "ApplicationInput",
  clientDirective: false,
};
const options: PagesRegistryOptions = {
  pagesDir: "src/flux-pages",
  outputFile: "src/.fluxfast/pages.generated.ts",
  target,
};
const registry = createPagesRegistrySnapshot(options);
console.log(registry.identifiers);
// e.g. ["home/index"] for one registered home/index.tsx page.
```

The generated module imports `ApplicationRoot as FluxRoot` and
`ApplicationInput as FluxApplicationProps` from the selected runtime; it keeps
the generated `fluxPages`, `FluxApplication`, and default registry names stable.
The runtime must also export the `ComponentRegistry` type. Its root receives the
application props with `registry` fixed to the generated allowlist. This template
still emits a React `createElement` wrapper; a target alone does not create a
Vue/Svelte renderer or satisfy the rest of an adapter's lifecycle contract.

`clientDirective: true` adds `"use client";`; false or omission leaves it out.
`runtimeImport` must be a non-empty string without control characters and is
serialized as module-specifier data. Generated string literals also escape HTML
delimiters and Unicode line separators while preserving their decoded values.
Root and props export names must be ASCII
JavaScript identifiers; names that would collide with generated locals are
aliased. All target fields are build-tool configuration, not server-selected
page data. Missing or malformed targets throw before scanning or writing.

Omitted `pagesDir` and `outputFile` use `src/flux-pages` and
`src/.fluxfast/pages.generated.ts`, resolved against the current working directory.
The shared constructor requires a target; the existing
`@fluxfast/next/generate` constructor keeps its optional options and Next defaults.

`checkFluxFastProject` compares expected bytes and reports absolute paths for
missing or stale files. It never creates directories, rewrites schema files,
or replaces artifacts. All schema-backed output compiles before generation's
first write. Replacements are atomic **per file**, not a transaction across all
six files. Destinations must stay inside the selected output directory;
symlink traversal and unsafe temporary-file replacement are rejected. See the
[generated artifact contract](/FluxFast-Docs/generated-artifacts/) for full safety semantics.

## Public export inventory

These fragments assume `manifest`, `options`, `validation`, `result`, `check`, and `error`
exist as in the examples above. Types describe data; they do not create a runtime
object or perform an operation.

FluxFast runs a FastAPI application and a Next.js application as one production
service. An external process manager starts one foreground `fluxfast start`
process; FluxFast supervises the two runtimes behind one public Next.js origin.

```text
browser or load balancer
        |
        | public HTTP
        v
Next.js 0.0.0.0:3000
        |
        | server-only FluxFast transport
        v
FastAPI 127.0.0.1:8123
```

FastAPI still owns application routes, authorization, validation, resources,
and mutations. The browser never needs the private backend address, so the
standard topology needs neither a second public port nor CORS configuration.
See [ADR-0007](/FluxFast-Docs/decisions/0007-production-runtime/) for the architectural
decision.

## Stable topology contract

The supported application boundary is one FluxFast application, one public
browser port, a public Next.js runtime, and a private FastAPI runtime. The two
request paths intentionally differ:

| Request | Stable path |
| --- | --- |
| Initial document / SSR | Browser → Next Server Component → server-side fetch to private FastAPI → rendered HTML |
| Client navigation, mutation, deferred, or live request | Browser same-origin fetch with `X-FluxFast: 1` → header-gated Next rewrite/transport route → private FastAPI |

Normal document requests are not sent through the header-gated client rewrite.
The browser does not receive or configure the private backend port. Changing
the standard topology to two public application services, requiring a browser
backend URL, or requiring CORS would be a breaking production-contract change.
The [v1.0 production topology gate](/FluxFast-Docs/releases/v1-0-production-topology/) records
repeatable installed-artifact and OCI image checks for this boundary.

## Stable Python CLI contract

These command names, option names, positional inputs, and major default
semantics are stable throughout 1.x:

| Command | Supported public inputs | Major semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fluxfast dev APP` | `--frontend`, `--backend-host`, `--backend-port`, `--frontend-host`, `--frontend-port`, `--no-reload`, `--startup-timeout` | Supervise reload-enabled FastAPI and the frontend behind one public development origin. |
| `fluxfast build` | `--frontend`, `--app` | Validate generated artifacts, optionally validate the backend contract, then run the existing frontend build script. |
| `fluxfast start APP` | `--frontend`, `--host`, `--port`, `--backend-host`, `--backend-port`, `--workers`, `--startup-timeout`, `--shutdown-timeout` | Start the prebuilt production artifact as one foreground supervised service. |
| `fluxfast doctor --production` | `--app`, `--frontend`, `--host`, `--port`, `--backend-host`, `--backend-port`, `--workers`, `--strict` | Inspect production readiness without modifying the project; `--production` remains required. |
| `fluxfast schema APP` | `--output`, `--check` | Export the deterministic backend schema, or compare an existing `--output` without writing; check mode requires that path. |
| `fluxfast types APP` | `--frontend`, `--check` | Compose backend schema export with the locally installed Next CLI; check mode is read-only. |

`APP` uses `module:attribute` syntax. A successful command exits `0`; usage,
validation, drift, startup, or child-process failure exits nonzero. Human
diagnostic sentences are not a compatibility surface. The deliberately
documented `fluxfast start` status categories below remain available, but
applications should not infer undocumented meanings from other nonzero values.

## Prepare and build

Install the Python and frontend dependencies before building. The frontend must
be initialized with `@fluxfast/next` and define non-empty `build` and `start`
scripts. FluxFast detects pnpm, Yarn, Bun, or npm from the frontend lockfile,
then the `packageManager` field; it defaults to npm when neither is present.
The selected package manager and local package binaries must already be on
`PATH`. Production commands never download dependencies.

Generate typed contracts during development, commit the generated files, and
check them in CI:

```bash
fluxfast types backend.main:app --frontend frontend
fluxfast types backend.main:app --frontend frontend --check
```

Create the production Next.js output explicitly:

```bash
fluxfast build --app backend.main:app --frontend frontend
```

Supplying `--app` makes the build validate the backend schema against the
committed generated files before it invokes the frontend's existing `build`
script. Without `--app`, FluxFast still checks adapter initialization and the
generated page registry. `fluxfast start` never builds or generates files; a
missing `.next/BUILD_ID` fails with an instruction to run `fluxfast build`.

## Validate and start

Inspect the finished artifact without modifying it:

```bash
fluxfast doctor --production \
  --app backend.main:app \
  --frontend frontend \
  --strict
```

Strict mode treats production-risk warnings, including process-local cache or
Live Resource coordination with multiple workers, as blocking. Run it in the
same environment and from the same artifact that will be deployed.

Start the service in the foreground:

```bash
fluxfast start backend.main:app \
  --frontend frontend
```

The supervisor starts FastAPI first, waits for its private readiness endpoint,
starts Next.js, and waits for the public listener. It reports `application
ready` only after that sequence succeeds. It sets `NODE_ENV=production`, starts
Uvicorn without reload, injects `FLUXFAST_BACKEND_URL` into the Next.js child as
server-only configuration, and removes `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUXFAST_BACKEND_URL` from
that child's environment.

Do not run `uvicorn` and `next start` as separate services for the ordinary
deployment. Advanced deployments may do so, but then they own the private
transport, supervision, health, and shutdown behavior that `fluxfast start`
normally provides.

## Configuration

Command-line options take precedence over environment variables. Defaults are
safe for the single-origin topology:

| CLI option | Environment | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--host` | `FLUXFAST_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Public Next.js bind address |
| `--port` | `FLUXFAST_PORT`, then `PORT` | `3000` | Public Next.js port |
| `--backend-host` | `FLUXFAST_BACKEND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Private FastAPI bind address |
| `--backend-port` | `FLUXFAST_BACKEND_PORT` | `8123` | Private FastAPI port |
| `--workers` | `FLUXFAST_WORKERS` | `1` | Uvicorn worker count |
| `--startup-timeout` | `FLUXFAST_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` | `30` seconds | Per-child readiness deadline |
| `--shutdown-timeout` | `FLUXFAST_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `20` seconds | Shared graceful-stop deadline |

`FLUXFAST_APP` can supply the application import to `fluxfast doctor` when
`--app` is omitted. `fluxfast start` deliberately requires its positional
`MODULE:ATTRIBUTE` application import.

### Canonical environment-variable inventory

This is the v0.9 inventory for FluxFast-owned runtime and reference-deployment
variables. Variables belonging to an application or deployment platform are
outside this list.

| Variable | Classification | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLUXFAST_HOST` | Public operator input | Public Next.js bind address for production commands. |
| `FLUXFAST_PORT` | Public operator input | Preferred public Next.js port. |
| `PORT` | Public compatibility input | Public-port fallback only when `FLUXFAST_PORT` and `--port` are absent. |
| `FLUXFAST_BACKEND_HOST` | Public operator input | Private FastAPI bind address; loopback by default. |
| `FLUXFAST_BACKEND_PORT` | Public operator input | Private FastAPI port. It is not exposed to the browser. |
| `FLUXFAST_WORKERS` | Public operator input | Uvicorn worker count. |
| `FLUXFAST_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` | Public operator input | Per-child production readiness deadline in seconds. |
| `FLUXFAST_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | Public operator input | Shared graceful-shutdown deadline in seconds. |
| `FLUXFAST_APP` | Public diagnostic input | Optional application import for `doctor --production`; it does not replace the positional `start` input. |
| `FLUXFAST_BACKEND_URL` | Server-only adapter input | Private backend origin used by the Next server. `dev` and `start` inject it; only advanced manually supervised topologies should set it. |
| `FLUXFAST_PRODUCTION_START` | Internal supervisor handshake | Prevents source generation during immutable production startup. Applications must not set or depend on it. |
| `FLUXFAST_COMPOSE_PORT` | Reference Compose input | Host-side port interpolation for this repository's `compose.yaml`; it is not read by the FluxFast runtime. |
| `FLUXFAST_STANDALONE` | Reference image-build input | Enables standalone Next.js output in this repository's `Dockerfile`; it is not a runtime setting or adapter API. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUXFAST_BACKEND_URL` | Deprecated and unsupported | Removed from supervised child environments. Do not expose a backend origin to browser bundles. |

`NODE_ENV` is a Node.js variable that FluxFast sets to `production` for the
supervised frontend; it is not FluxFast-owned configuration. `REDIS_URL` in the
reference application is application input: FluxFast never switches cache or
broker implementations merely because it exists. Variables beginning with
`FLUXFAST_TEST_`, `FLUXFAST_E2E_`, `FLUXFAST_BENCHMARK_`, or
`FLUXFAST_ARTIFACT_` are repository test/build controls, not supported
application configuration.

Keep the backend on loopback unless a deliberately non-standard topology needs
external access. `fluxfast doctor --production` warns when it is not loopback.
Do not pass database, Redis, or application secrets through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
variables. Supply secrets through the host, container runtime, or deployment
platform; never commit them to generated files or bake `.env` files into an
image.

## Workers and Redis

`--workers N` delegates the worker pool to Uvicorn. One process may use the
default `MemoryResourceCache` and `MemoryLiveBroker`. With multiple workers or
multiple application instances:

- use `RedisLiveBroker` when Live Resource signals must reach every worker;
- use `RedisResourceCache` for shared positive-TTL values and invalidation; or
- keep live resources at `ttl=0` if the resource cache intentionally remains
  process-local.

Every cooperating process must use the same Redis database, cache namespace,
and broker channel prefix. Use different namespaces for different applications
and environments. Redis is infrastructure, not part of the public FluxFast
service. See [distributed resource coherence](/FluxFast-Docs/distributed-cache/) for the
configuration and failure contract.

## Health and readiness

Probe through the public origin so the result covers both Next.js and its
private connection to FastAPI:

| Path | Success | Not ready |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /fluxfast/healthz` | `200 {"status":"ok"}` | `503 {"status":"not_ready"}` when the private probe cannot be validated |
| `GET /fluxfast/readyz` | `200 {"status":"ready"}` | `503 {"status":"not_ready"}` |

Both responses use `Cache-Control: no-store` and intentionally omit PIDs,
ports, paths, resource identities, Redis details, and credentials. Readiness is
false until FastAPI initialization completes, while shutdown is in progress,
or when a configured FluxFast-owned dependency with a bounded `healthcheck()`
fails. Arbitrary application databases and services remain application-owned.

Use readiness—not liveness—to decide when a new instance may receive traffic.
The public probe also prevents a load balancer from accepting an instance whose
Next.js process is alive but cannot reach FastAPI.

## Shutdown, failures, and logs

Run `fluxfast start` as the foreground process. It works under an ordinary
shell, systemd, supervisord, aaPanel, Docker, and Podman. Child stdout and
stderr stay attached to the supervisor, so the outer platform owns log
collection and rotation.

SIGTERM or SIGINT starts an idempotent shutdown. FluxFast stops Next.js and
FastAPI process groups, waits within the configured shared shutdown deadline,
and kills a child that does not exit. A requested clean shutdown exits `0`. If
either child exits unexpectedly, FluxFast stops its sibling and exits non-zero;
it never intentionally leaves half of the application running.

Shutdown covers descendants in the owned process groups even when their direct
parent has already exited. They share the existing graceful deadline and bounded
kill/reap fallback. When FluxFast is PID 1 or a subreaper, it also reaps adopted
descendants from those groups; it does not reap unrelated application children.
Development supervision restores both SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers and continues
sibling cleanup if one stop operation fails.

FluxFast composes the application's existing FastAPI lifespan, preserving its
yielded state and closing owned broker/cache dependencies after application
teardown, including failed startup or teardown. Readiness stops before teardown.
Concurrent `close()` callers wait for the same cleanup; reentrant calls from
that cleanup do not deadlock. AnyIO cancellation does not skip dependency
cleanup, and externally supplied Redis clients remain application-owned. This
does not extend the process supervisor's shutdown deadline: forced termination
remains the fallback for an application or dependency that will not stop.
See the [v1.0 server lifecycle gate](/FluxFast-Docs/releases/v1-0-server-lifecycle/) for
repeatable real-process and real-Redis coverage.

Common `fluxfast start` status codes are:

| Status | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0` | Requested clean shutdown |
| `1` | A supervised child exited unexpectedly |
| `2` | Invalid production configuration |
| `3` | Project, runtime, package-manager, or process validation failed |
| `4` | A child failed to become ready within the startup timeout |
| `5` | The production Next.js build is missing |

Supervisor messages are prefixed with `[fluxfast]`. Do not parse human log
text as a health API; use the public probe paths.

## Process managers and aaPanel

Configure an external process manager to run the top-level FluxFast command,
keep it in the foreground, send SIGTERM during stop, and respect a stop grace
period longer than `FLUXFAST_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`. For example:

```bash
fluxfast start backend.main:app \
  --frontend /srv/my-app/frontend \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 3000
```

When aaPanel requires a project category, use a Node.js project because the
public-facing process is Next.js, but make its start command the command above.
Do not create a second aaPanel project for FastAPI and do not configure aaPanel
to run only `next start`.

FluxFast does not generate systemd, supervisord, or aaPanel configuration. Set
the working directory, environment, user, restart policy, and log destination
using the platform's normal facilities.

## Reverse proxies and Live Resource streams

A reverse proxy or load balancer should target only the public Next.js port. It
must forward the request method and body, preserve the effective host and
FluxFast request headers, and terminate HTTPS according to the platform's own
documentation.

Live Resources use fetch-based Server-Sent Events. Every intermediary must:

- allow long-lived HTTP responses and propagate disconnects;
- stream response bytes without buffering;
- avoid caching or indefinitely buffering transformations/compression for
  `text/event-stream`;
- preserve cookies, authorization, and `X-FluxFast-*` request headers; and
- use an idle timeout safely above the configured heartbeat interval.

FluxFast emits `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache,
no-transform`, and `X-Accel-Buffering: no` for the stream. No WebSocket upgrade
is required. FluxFast intentionally does not ship proxy-provider
configuration; follow the provider's current TLS, forwarding, and streaming
documentation. See [deploying Live Resources](/FluxFast-Docs/live-deployment/) for Nginx
and Nginx Proxy Manager examples.

## Upgrades and horizontal deployment

The basic upgrade is build a new immutable artifact, stop the old service, and
start the new one. FluxFast does not provide a zero-downtime or rolling
orchestrator. A deployment platform may instead:

1. start the new instance;
2. wait for its public `/fluxfast/readyz` response;
3. send new traffic to it and drain the old instance; and
4. send SIGTERM to the old supervisor.

Multiple FluxFast instances each expose one public port and supervise their own
private FastAPI runtime. Put them behind the platform load balancer and use the
same explicitly namespaced Redis configuration when cache or live coherence
must cross instances.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| `No Next.js production build found` | Run `fluxfast build --app ... --frontend ...` in the artifact build phase. |
| Package-manager executable missing | Install the manager selected by the frontend lockfile and put it on `PATH`. |
| Frontend `start` script rejected | Define a non-empty `scripts.start`, normally `next start`. |
| Public readiness is `503` | Inspect FastAPI startup and FluxFast-owned Redis/cache health before exposing the instance. |
| Browser tries a backend origin | Remove browser-facing backend URLs and start the app through `fluxfast start`. |
| Live updates arrive in bursts | Disable proxy buffering/caching and exclude SSE from buffering compression. |
| Multi-worker updates diverge | Run the strict production doctor and configure the required Redis cache/broker topology. |
| Shutdown is forcibly killed | Increase the outer platform grace period or the FluxFast timeout after measuring real cleanup. |

For container-specific operation, continue with [container deployment](/FluxFast-Docs/containers/).

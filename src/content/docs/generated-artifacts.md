FluxFast 0.9 treats the generated frontend API as a compatibility surface. The
Python application and Pydantic models remain authoritative; generated files
are the checked, local TypeScript representation consumed by application code.

## Stable filenames

The following names are stable throughout FluxFast 1.x:

```text
schema.generated.json
types.generated.ts
validators.generated.ts
routes.generated.ts
mutations.generated.ts
pages.generated.ts
```

They live together in the `.fluxfast` output directory selected by the
supported root or `src/` project layout. Changing between those layouts may
move the directory, but renaming one of these files would break generated
imports and is therefore a breaking change.

`fluxfast init` also writes `agent-knowledge.md` into that directory. It is a
generated AI-agent integration guide rather than a TypeScript or developer
schema API, so it is outside the semantic application-code contract below. The
initializer refreshes it independently and maintains bounded reference blocks
in the project-root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`; content outside those blocks is
user-owned and preserved.

## Stable generated API

Under unreleased v1.2 development, the framework-neutral compilers and safe
file-writing/checking infrastructure live in [`@fluxfast/codegen`](/FluxFast-Docs/codegen-api/).
Codegen scans and renders page registries through explicit runtime/export targets;
Next.js retains its public generator API and automatically supplies its default
target. This ownership change preserves all six Next artifact bytes;
it does not change the published v1.1 setup commands or manifest protocol.
The separate unreleased `fluxfast-codegen generate --adapter next` binary uses
the same artifact engine without replacing Next's existing `fluxfast generate`
binary. Its `--schema-file` and read-only `--check` modes preserve the same bytes.

Application code may depend on these semantic exports:

| Artifact | Public generated concepts |
| --- | --- |
| `types.generated.ts` | Explicit application interfaces and aliases, Pydantic model names, `${PascalCaseResourceKey}Resource` resource aliases, mutation body types, `resourceKeys`, `GeneratedFluxResourceMap`, and the `FluxResourceMap` module augmentation. |
| `validators.generated.ts` | `${ContractName}Validator` constants, `validators`, and `validatorDiagnostics`. |
| `routes.generated.ts` | The `routes` object and its named page-route builders. |
| `mutations.generated.ts` | The `mutations` object and its named JSON mutation helpers. |
| `pages.generated.ts` | `fluxPages`, `FluxApplication`, and the default page registry export. |

`schema.generated.json` follows the separately versioned
[`fluxfast-schema/2` contract](/FluxFast-Docs/developer-schema/). It does not expose a
TypeScript module API.

The guarantee covers TypeScript meaning: names, accepted inputs, return types,
and module relationships. It does not freeze whitespace, comment wording,
quote style, semantically irrelevant declaration ordering, or private helper
implementations. A newer FluxFast release may reformat generated source, so
regenerate artifacts during upgrades. For one FluxFast version and identical
input, generation remains byte-for-byte deterministic and `--check` compares
those deterministic bytes without modifying files.

The [v1.0 generated-contract proof](/FluxFast-Docs/releases/v1-0-generated-contract/)
records the promotion comparison with a v0.9.0 semantic export and
normalized-source baseline for the same application contract.

## Name derivation

Common declarations retain predictable names:

- A resource key such as `hotel_rooms` produces `HotelRoomsResource` and
  `resourceKeys.hotelRooms`.
- A Pydantic model title such as `Room` remains the exported `Room` model.
- An explicit `define_type("RegistrationInput", ...)` contract produces
  `RegistrationInput`; its explicit contract name takes precedence over a
  different schema title.
- A JSON mutation named `create_room` produces `CreateRoomBody` and
  `mutations.createRoom`.
- When the same mutation name and path have multiple HTTP methods, the method
  is included, for example `SaveRoomPatchBody` and `mutations.saveRoomPatch`.
- A page route named `hotel_rooms` produces `routes.hotelRooms`.
- Each supported root contract named `RegistrationInput` produces
  `RegistrationInputValidator`; resource and mutation roots follow the same
  `${ContractName}Validator` rule.

ASCII word boundaries, underscores, hyphens, and existing camel-case
boundaries are normalized into PascalCase or camelCase as appropriate. A name
that normalizes to an existing generated symbol is rejected with a collision
diagnostic rather than silently renamed. Changing these derivation rules after
0.9 would be a breaking generated-API change.

## Generation and replacement safety

FluxFast compiles and validates the complete artifact set in memory before the
first write. A schema or compiler failure therefore leaves every existing file
untouched.

Each successful file replacement then uses this sequence:

```text
same-directory exclusive temporary file
→ write complete content
→ fsync the file
→ close the file
→ rename over the destination
→ best-effort temporary-file cleanup on failure
```

Keeping the temporary file beside its destination avoids a cross-filesystem
rename. Each destination is either its previous complete file or its new
complete file when replacement succeeds. This is deliberately a **per-file**
guarantee, not multi-file transactional atomicity: a filesystem failure during
a later replacement may leave earlier artifacts updated. Fix the filesystem
error and rerun generation to converge the deterministic set.

The generated-artifact contract tests exercise the replacement path on both
Linux and Windows. `fluxfast generate --check` and `fluxfast types --check`
remain read-only alternatives for CI drift detection.

## Upgrade guidance

Commit generated files only when that is the consuming project's policy. On an
upgrade, run generation once, review semantic changes separately from cosmetic
diffs, then run the read-only check:

```bash
fluxfast types backend.main:app --frontend frontend
fluxfast types backend.main:app --frontend frontend --check
```

guide](/FluxFast-Docs/nextjs-adapter/), and [versioning](/FluxFast-Docs/versioning/) for the surrounding
